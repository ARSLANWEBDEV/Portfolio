Documentation for Registration and Login Form
Overview
This document explains how the Registration and Login Form works and guides beginners through its main features, functionality, and usage. The form is a simple user interface for creating an account (Registration) and logging into the system (Login).
Structure
The webpage contains two main parts:
1.	Registration Form
2.	Login Form
Users first fill out the Registration Form to create an account. After successful registration, they can switch to the Login Form to log in.
Features
1.	Responsive Design: The page looks good on both large screens and mobile devices.
2.	Password Toggle: Users can show or hide their password by clicking the eye icon.
3.	Basic Validation: Ensures all required fields are filled. Checks if passwords match and are strongenough.
4.	Animations: The form and background have smooth animations to improve user experience.
5.	Success Popup: Displays a success message after registration.
6.	Interactive Buttons: Buttons change color when hovered over for better interaction.
How It Works
1. Registration Form
The registration form asks for the following details:
-	First Name: Your first name.
-	Last Name: Your last name.
-	Email: A valid email address (e.g., yourname@example.com).
-	Date of Birth: Select your date of birth from a calendar.
-	Password: Choose a secure password.
-	Confirm Password: Retype the password to ensure it matches.
Steps to Register:
1.	Fill in all the fields.
2.	Make sure the password is strong and matches the confirmation.
3.	Click the Register button.
4.	If successful, you'll see a success message and be redirected to the Login Form.
Common Errors:
-	If the passwords don't match, an error message will appear.
-	If the password is too weak (e.g., less than 8 characters), you'll get an alert.
2. Login Form
The login form asks for:
-	Email: Enter the email used during registration.
-	Password: Enter the matching password.
Steps to Log In:
1.	Fill in the email and password fields.
2.	Click the Login button.
3.	If the credentials are correct, you can proceed to the next page (logic to handle this would beadded later).
Switch Back to Registration:
- If you want to register a new account, click the Back to Registration button.
Features Explained
Password Toggle: You can toggle between showing or hiding the password by clicking the eye icon. Success Popup: After successfully registering, a small box pops up with the message: Successfully registered!. This disappears after a few seconds.
